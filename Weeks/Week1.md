### Score: 8/10

**Reasons for score**

At the beginning of this Week, I was quite worried about pairing, as I have been used to code on my own. I also tend to compare myself to others and I found hard not to do so. Yet, I enjoyed pairing really much more than expected, I felt I learned so much from my pair partners, and also from going back every time to the 'weakest' repo. It allowed me to understand a lot, even tough I am still confused with some concepts ! I found also difficult to set appropriate and achievable daily goals, so that's definitely something I have to work on. Besides, I started to write a summary -cheat sheet- on TDD, to not forget what I learned this week and use it in a near future. So far, I enjoyed so much this week and the way we're taught.

 **Material to focus on**
  - TDD exericse for 1 and 2 classes
  - OO Principles more specifically getting to grips with encaptulation, abstraction, SRP.
  - Mocking and complete 2 exercises.
