## Retrospective

### Achievements this week
- [ ] Succesfully finished the notes.app
- [x] Finish cheatsheet on TDD 
- [x] Break one class into two classes that work together
- [x] Tested classes using doubles 

### Score: 7/10

#### Reasons for Score

This week 2 has been a bit harder than last week ! I had also a lot to do for my personal business that week and have had less time to track my progress and goals, something that I will fix this week end. Overall, I learned a lot and felt really much more comfortable in pairing as well as testing.

### Material to re-cover
 - OO principles
 - Mockings/Doubles
