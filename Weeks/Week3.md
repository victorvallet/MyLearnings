## Retrospective
### Achievements this week
- [x] Build a simple web app
- [ ] Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- [x] Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- [x] Explain the MVC pattern
### Score: 8
#### Reasons for Score

Really great week 3! I have already a good background of html/css, but I am so glad I now have a good understanding of the basics of the web.. I really lacked this understanding of HTTP requests/response, and the diagrams really helped me ! This week was still tough, a lot of new concepts such as Capybara and Sinatra. Again, as I just deployed my Vue js web app, I was familiar to some extent to web app development, but going back to a really simple framework such as Sinatra, really helped me get a better understanding of the backstage (routing, requests, etc)

### Material to re-cover
- Alternatives to Global Variables 
- Debugging Web Applications 
- Read more on sessions in Sinatra
